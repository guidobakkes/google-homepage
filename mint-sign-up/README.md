HTML Form Mint.com
==================

This is yet another exercise for TheOdinProject.
The goal is to recreate the Mint.com sign up page in HTML and CSS.

##Exercise guidelines

In this project, you'll get a chance to rebuild the form used by Mint.com for signing up new users. They have been highly praised for the design and simplicity of their site, and their signup process is very clean.

The page is very straightforward, so you should be able to clone it even if your CSS skills aren't perfect. As usual, don't worry about any of the dynamic functionality on the page or finding the specific icons they use or having the form actually submit. The point is to make it look like the real page as much as you reasonably can.
